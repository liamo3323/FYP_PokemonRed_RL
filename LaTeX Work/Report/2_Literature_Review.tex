\section{Literature Review}

Other similar projects which applies RL to find the optimal battling strategy by Kalose et al \cite{kalose2018optimal}. 
Their work focuses on one aspect of the game and does not have a large enough search space to justify application of RL techniques. 
Another similar work by Flaherty, Jimenez and Abbasi \cite{flaherty2021playing} applies RL algorithms A2C and DQN to play Pokémon 
Red. However, this piece of work does not go into enough detail about the comparison of different RL techniques to find the best
 method to train an agent to complete large complex environments with a large search space. I aim to extend their research in 
 applying RL to Pokémon Red by applying more algorithms and various techniques RL that I will go into more detail in section 3.
