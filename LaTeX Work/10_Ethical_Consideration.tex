\section{Ethical Consideration}

The ethical considerations when it comes to RL are limited. In comparison to other fields of machine learning, RL is not dependent on outside sources for data. The dataset that trains reinforcemnet learning agents is dependent on the environment, therefore is not vulnerable to ethical or privacy concerns outside of the scope of the environment. 

The ethical considerations that are present in this project is the use of the Pokemon Red ROM used within the environment. The Pokemon Red ROM is a game that is owned by Nintendo and not open source. However, the nature of this work is for educational purposes and holds no commerical motivation. 

In addition, the nature of this research is limited to the actions within a game and holds no connection to the real world and any personal information.
