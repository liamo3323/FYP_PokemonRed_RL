\subsection{Battling the Gym Leader}

Another detail that the agent learned was that it learned to defeat the first gym leader in the fewest amount of steps. Compared to all the other pokemon battles, the agent learned to choose a different move to the one normally used to defeat the gym leader. This is because the gym leader has a different set of pokemon with different types, so the agent learned to choose the most effective move against the gym leader's pokemon. This is possibly due to the reward function assigning a high amount of reward for defeating the first gym, which the agent was able to learn the critical moves to defeat the gym leader because of the high amount of reward.
