\section{Ethical Consideration}

When conducting research in any field, taking the ethical and legal considerations of the work conducted is as integral to the research conducted. Through out the work conducted in this project, all legal and ethical considerations have been taken into account. This was ensured through the guidance of my supervisor and by following the BCS Code of Conduct. In addition, following the ethical guidance of the University of Surrey, the Self-Assessment for Goverance and Ethics (SAGE) was completed to ensure that the research conducted was ethical and legal, which can be found at Appendix %!

\subsection{Data Collection}

No data was collected in this project. The data that was used was the Pokemon Red ROM, which was used to create the environment for the reinforcement learning agent. The data was not used for any other purpose than to create the environment for the agent to learn from. Therefore, the only type of data used for this research was directly used for the environments and no personal data was used for this research.

\subsection{Data Storage}

The limited data that is used is stored within the environment and only processed for the purpose of training the agent. The data in question is also not directly remembered or stored within the agent, only an association of how to react to the data within the environment is stored. Furthermore, no data is stored outside of the environment. 

\subsection{Legal \& Ethical Considerations: Do Not Harm}

The development of AI and machine learning has always been a field that has been scrutinised for the potential harm that it can cause in the future with its development. However, for the purposes of this research, the development of the reinforcement learning agent is limited to the environment of Pokemon Red, which is a game and holds no real world implications and marketed towards children. Therefore, the development of the agent is not harmful to any individual or group of individuals. Moreover, the greater purpose of this research is to assist the field of multi-objective reinforcement learning by providing more data for benchmarking and comparison, which holds just as many positive implications as negative.

\subsection{Legal \& Ethical Considerations: Informed Consent}

No human participation or data were required for this research to be conducted. Therfore, there was no need for informed consent to be obtained. 

\subsection{Legal \& Ethical Considerations: Confidentiality of Data}

No private, personal or confidental data was used for the purpose of this research. The only issue regarding this is the confidentality of the Pokemon Red ROM, which is owned by Nintendo. However, the use of the ROM was for educational purposes and not for commercial gain.
