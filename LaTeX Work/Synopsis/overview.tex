\section{Introduction}
This section needs to contain an introduction to the problem, aims and objectives (0.5 pages)
\par
[FROM THE HANDBOOK] \newline
It is designed to help you initially choose a project. During the academic year, it also helps
you keep track of deliverables; a complete description of each deliverable is provided. Finally,
this document specifies how the project is assessed, including pointers to marking criteria,
details on the examination, as well as the process for dealing with complaints

\subsection{Aims}

\begin{itemize}
   \item [\ding{54}] The aim of this project is to develop a RL agent to play Pokémon Red.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
   \item [\ding{169}]Explore and understand the use of RL techniques in a custom game environment.
   \item [\ding{169}] Design and implement Pokémon Red game to be a suitable RL environment.
   \item [\ding{169}] Review and critique literature that applies RL to Pokémon.
   \item [\ding{169}] Evaluate the performance of different RL algorithms used to train agents within the environment.
   \item [\ding{169}] Evaluate performance of agents to different forms of reward incentive.
   \item [\ding{169}] Recommend further developments to the project and applications to real world projects.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Extension Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
   \item [\ding{168}] Implement different methods to improve the agent’s learning and understanding of the environment.
   \item [\ding{168}] Evaluate performance of the agent when given data in different forms.
   \item [\ding{168}] Evaluate performance of internal agent to performance of literature.
\end{itemize}

\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{What other similar work has been done?}

\subsection{What will I introduce that build son other's work?}

\section{Technical overview}

\begin{itemize}
   \item Hyperparameter tuning to find optimal performance per experiment.
   \item Comparison of Gradient Descent and Value based models.
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Value based:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Proximal Policy Optimization
         \end{itemize}
      \item Gradient Descent:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Actor-Critic Methods: A2C 
            \item Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
         \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}
   \item Evaluating change in Q values to learning the optimal model using DQN
   \item Explore the benefit of applying meta learning.
\end{itemize}
