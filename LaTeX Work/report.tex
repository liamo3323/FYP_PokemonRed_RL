This project explores the use of reinforcement learning in Pokémon Red to explore multi-objective environments. The project aims to create a reinforcement learning agent that can learn to play Pokémon Red. The project will use the OpenAI Gymnasium framework to create a custom environment for the agent to interact with. The agent will be trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization, Deep Q-Network and Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network and compared to determine which algorithm is most effective at multi-objective reinforcement learning.
